Chrome extension for full-page screenshot
--------------------------------------------

The extension captures a full-page screenshot of a web page by scrolling down, capturing the current view, and combines all the captured images into one giant image.

___The primary goal___ of this extension is to enable full-page screenshot within Browser tests (e.g. Selenium, WebDriver). It offers Javascripts APIs for managing screenshots (e.g. specify the location of the screenshot file).

__The secondary goal__ of this extension is to build and earn trust. A Chrome extension can see almost everything you do on a web page. It's powerful and useful but dangerous. You should NEVER install a Chrome extension from an unknown developer. You should ALWAYS read its reviews, inspect its source code, and trusts the developer before install a Chrome extension. See: [Worst case scenario, what can a Chrome extension do with “Your data on all websites” and “Your tabs and browsing activity”?](https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/15259/worst-case-scenario-what-can-a-chrome-extension-do-with-your-data-on-all-websi).
